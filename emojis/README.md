# Emoji Iterator - Go package  [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/bgadrian/emoji-compressor/emojis)
The package emojis can be used as an iterator over most of the emoji in Unicode in a predefined (but random) order.

Current count: **1183 emojis** from which **1011** have 1 rune length.

### Demo
We have built a full working demo at [emoji-compress.com](https://emoji-compress.com/) â€¼

### Example 
```go
db := Iterator{}
db.Next() //returns "ðŸ˜€"
db.Next() //returns "ðŸ˜¬"
//repeat for 1181 times
db.Next() //returns "" and emojis.EOF error
```

The function **Iterator.NextSingleRune()** is used to fetch the next single-rune length emoji. The result is:
```
1 string (ex: "ðŸ˜€")
1 rune the string has len([]rune("ðŸ˜€")) == 1
>1 bytes. Even though is 1 character it has more bytes (see Unicode).
```

Emojis package has unit tests, GoDoc and Examples.
*The emojis are hardcoded for now, until we can find a better solution.*\

### About
This package is part of a [group of emoji-related encoding and compression algorithms](https://github.com/bgadrian/emoji-compressor) built for fun and academic purposes in Go.
