  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Emoji-compressor</strong> is an open-source library, written in Go, as a side-project. This website is just a demo for
    the package.</p>
  <p>We have ported to Go some known basic encoding and compression algorithms and added the emoji twist. Some of the methods
    may result in smaller texts (as in the number of characters), but larger in bytes.</p>
