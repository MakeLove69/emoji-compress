  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78" target="_blank">LZ78</a> 
  is a lossless data compression algorithm, which form the basis of several ubiquitous compression schemes, 
  including GIF and the DEFLATE algorithm used in PNG and ZIP.</p>
  <p>It has a simple <a href"http://www.stringology.org/DataCompression/lz78/index_en.html">algorithm</a>
  which consist of finding repeating phrases (sequences of characters) and storing them in a tree like dictionary.</p>

  <h1><a href="https://github.com/bgadrian/emoji-compress/tree/master/bytesmap">Bytes map - encoding</a></h1>
  <p>It is a simple encoding method be useful to "humanize" hard to remember/recognize texts such as Hashes, keys, other encodes like base64, ip's and so on.</p>
  <p>The algorithm is very simple: it split the string in a series of bytes, and map each byte by its value to an unique emoji. A byte can have only 255 possible values, so we only need 
  255 different emojis to encode ... anything. The package is a Go port of @ayende's

  <h1><a href="https://github.com/bgadrian/emoji-compress/tree/master/dictionary">Dictionary - replacing words</a></h1>
  <p>Package dictionary is a small package that allows encoding (or compression) of strings by replacing each unique word with an emoji.
  Each compress generates a new dictionary and an encoded version of the text (archive), based on the words found in the text. </p>
  <p>There are some technical limitations: you cannot have emojis in the original text; 
only works with a max of 1000 unique words and a new dictionary is generated for each text.</p>

  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Emoji-compress</strong> is an open-source library, written in Go, as a side-project. This website is just a demo for
    the package.</p>
  <p>We have ported to Go some known basic encoding and compression algorithms and added the emoji twist. Some of the methods
    may result in smaller texts (as in the number of characters), but larger in bytes.</p>
